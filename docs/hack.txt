8) Implementation - step-by-step checklist (concrete tasks)

Follow these ordered steps — each is a deliverable you can tick off:

Phase 0 — Prep

 Create GitHub repo + README (requirement for deliverables). 

EQREV_Hackathon_Agentic_AI

 Provision Postgres (Neon / Supabase) and create DB schema.

 Set up n8n instance (cloud or Docker) and obtain webhook base URL.

Phase 1 — Data & ETL

 Load sample CSVs (sales & inventory provided in brief) into DB (or DuckDB for dev). 

EQREV_Hackathon_Agentic_AI

 Write ETL scripts to clean, aggregate daily sales, and update inventory snapshots.

 Create SQL views for common queries (7-day_sales_by_city, avg_3day_sales_by_product_city).

Phase 2 — Forecasting & analytics

 Implement baseline rolling-average forecasts.

 Implement Prophet model and store forecasts in a forecasts table.

 Unit tests for forecast accuracy on historical data.

Phase 3 — Decision logic & agent

 Implement core allocation & reorder logic (functions with clear inputs/outputs).

 Wrap DB queries as safe tools for LangChain (only allow certain SQL templates / aggregates).

 Build LangChain agent that:

Receives user text

Chooses which tools to call

Returns recommended action(s) + rationale

 Add logging/audit for agent decisions.

Phase 4 — Automation (n8n)

 Build n8n workflows:

Warehouse notification (email + DB update)

Supplier PO creation (email or API)

Allocation DB update flow

 Test each webhook with sample payloads.

Phase 5 — Frontend / Integration

 Build Streamlit UI: dashboards, agent console, action confirmation modals.

 Hook frontend to backend API endpoints for ask_agent, get_dashboard, execute_action.

 Display response + allow “Execute” (which calls backend endpoint that posts webhook to n8n).

Phase 6 — Deployment

 Deploy frontend to Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud. 

EQREV_Hackathon_Agentic_AI

 Deploy backend (FastAPI) to Render/Railway or run alongside frontend if supported.

 Configure DB connection & environment variables securely (no secrets in repo).

Phase 7 — Testing & Demo prep

 Implement the example scenarios from the brief and record a demo script with the exact queries. 

EQREV_Hackathon_Agentic_AI

 Smoke tests for all n8n flows ensuring idempotency.

 Create README with setup + “How to run locally” + deployed URL.
